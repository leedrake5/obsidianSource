,Notes: ,,,
,,,,
,Smith et al 1977 cites Hawaii as a source - this needs to be sourced agaist the actual sources,,,
,,,,
,"There are two sources called ""Magdalena"" - one in NM and one in MEX. Need to find out if data is in correct place. The NM source will be called - internally - NEW MAGDALENA",,,
,,,,
,Thomas 2009 (Rapa Nui) data is not sourced* but the doc does provide a labeled ratio graph and we  have data on individual sources - need to source Thomas 2009,,,
,,,,
,"Davis et al. 1995 and Hughes 2007b identify the Powder River source in Montana as 'NonVolcanic Glass"" (There is a Y vs Sr graph in the Hughes document) - include as an obsidian or delegate to the ranks of chert* tektite* clink* etc. and not provide data",,,
,,,,
,Need to sort thru Sahul to Sunda and out thru Polynesian regions - area uses 'glass' to refer to ALL volcanic glass* not just obsidian,,,
,,,,
,There are two volcanic formations named Aqua Fria* one in Sonora and the other in New Mexico - data should only be from Mexico* but should double check,,,
